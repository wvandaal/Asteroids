HTML/CSS/SCRIPT NOTES

+ DOCTYPE html
	- relic from XHTML days
	- used to be specific, very general now
+ <head>
	- store stylesheets, scripts, etc.
		- ** best practice is actually to load JS scripts last so that content will render first, followed by scripts
	- loaded first, before rest of page
+ CSS precedence
	- html tags (h1, body, ul) have lowest precedence
	- classes have precedence over html tags
	- ids are unique and have precedence over everything
+ CSS Rules
	- undefined attributes inherit from their parents
	- body h1 { rules } will apply all rules therein to all h1s within the body, no matter how far they are nested
	- body > h1 { rules } will apply all rules therein to all h1s nested one level deep in the body
	- specify tags with certain attributes by using h1[attibute='value']
+ The html Block Model
	- width/height
		- unspecified, will grow to the width of the parent and then wrap the contents of the block (div/span/pre)
		- max/min-width/height can be used in conjunction with width and height to specify bounds of the content relative to the scaling of the page, etc.
	- padding
		- adds padding outside of block
			- e.g. if the width of the block is 100 and the padding is 10, the total width will be 120
			- background color, etc. will apply to padded space as well as content
	- border
		- added outside of content and padding
	- margin
		- "private" space around block
		- empty space, does not have and styling applied to it
